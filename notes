need the amod visual

the second function of the sustain envelope chain re-inserts the same function into "ons"
possible the second function of the Attack/Decay chain inserts removes itself and inserts the sustain
good night!


sustain is amod
release is feedback
also volume on RELEASE

reverbs is a fn of a multiple / ratio of the wavelength
feedback is a fn of a max of half the wavelength

shuffle feedbacks for rapid keypress
must share all feed backs between two parts duh

the release is a good target for GPU

env needs easing options

iir is master lebel

if release before A+D change on fn to complete envelope series and drop

set a phase change bit if release changed the phase

reverse midi controls + live stream = let them try it live
